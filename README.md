## Why?

* `msg2` is already available in `PKGBUILD` packages in Arch Linux, as a `bash` function.
* Recently, `namcap` has begun to discourage the use.
* This utility provides the same functionality, but *should* be unproblematic, from the viewpoint of `namcap`.
* Makes `msg2` available to any distro, not just Arch Linux.
